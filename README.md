**PyPrism** is a project aimed at developing a fully functional 3D modeling and rendering toolkit using only Python and the `cmu_graphics` library. This project will delve into the fundamentals of 3D rendering like matrix transformations, perspective projection, and basic shading. Alongside a basic 3D modeling toolkit, the project will also feature a path-traced renderer for realistic lighting simulations.

Key features of the project include:

- **3D Object Rendering:** Ability to render primative 3D objects like planes and cubes.
- **3D Modeling:** Ability to create and manipulate 3D objects in a 3D space.
- **Interactive Camera Control:** Users can navigate/interact with the 3D space using the keyboard and mouse.
- **Path-Traced Renderer:** Realistic lighting simulation.
