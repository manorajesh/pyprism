**PyPrism** is a comprehensive 3D modeling and rendering toolkit entirely in Python, rendered with the `cmu_graphics` library. The project will implement everything from scratch from matrix operations, to perspective projection, to path tracing. The goal is to provide a simple and intuitive interface for creating and manipulating 3D objects in a virtual space, as well as a path-traced rendering engine for realistic lighting effects.

In addition to a functional 3D modeling environment that allows users to create and manipulate objects in a virtual space, PyPrism will include a path-traced rendering engine. This will simulate realistic lighting effects, such as reflections, refractions, and global illumination, using a physically accurate approach to light transport.

Key features of the project include:

- **3D Object Rendering:** Ability to render primative 3D objects like planes and cubes. Also be able to import `.obj` files.
- **3D Modeling:** Ability to create and manipulate 3D objects in a 3D space.
- **Interactive Camera Control:** Users can navigate/interact with the 3D space using the keyboard and mouse.
- **Path-Traced Renderer:** Realistic lighting simulation.
